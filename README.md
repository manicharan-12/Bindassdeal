## Assumptions Made During Development

The backend server for handling authentication and CRUD operations is already set up and running at http://localhost:5000.

User credentials are securely stored and verified using appropriate security measures (e.g., hashing passwords).

The application is designed for demonstration purposes and may require additional features and enhancements for production use.
